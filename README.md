# Hi, I'm Mido 👋

I’m a Computer Engineering student with a passion for AI, Machine Learning, and creative tech. I'm always chasing the “why” behind how things work — whether it’s algorithms, systems, patterns in data, or human behavior.

I'm currently building my foundation in ML algorithms, data structures, and intelligent systems, and I’m exploring creative paths like video production, storytelling, design, and music. I love mixing technical skills with creativity to make things that actually mean something.

I’m open to internships, collaborations, and cool tech projects — especially anything involving AI/ML, automation, full-stack dev, or digital creativity.
